			Allie Furlotti:
				<p>Allie has always wanted to be a performer. Even though she  fell in love with<br>
				 stand up and sketch comedy, she was too afraid to stand up and try it.  But<br>
	 		 	 now she hosts mics and showcases and co-produces shows as Broken Zipper.  Allie<br>
	  	 	 loves the community Broken Zipper creates because the audience is supportive<br>
		 	 	 and the comics are diverse and love their craft. Allie has a style of comedy<br>
		  	 which is a mix of stories, performance art and weird observations.</p>
			<br>
			 Dorothy Geary
			 <p>When Dorothy started standup, she had no idea she would become so caught<br>
				  up in the Portland comedy community.  The comedians and audience, who<br>
					are almost all much younger, welcomed her to standup as a performer and<br>
					 host. Now Dorothy also loves co-producing Broken Zipper Comedy shows<br>
					 that represent the full range of diverse comedians and comedic styles<br>
					 from Portland and out of state comedians.  She also actively supports<br>
					 the growth of new comedians.</p>
