			<br>
				<div class="year">Allie has always wanted to be a performer. Even though she  fell in love with
				 stand up and sketch comedy, she was too afraid to stand up and try it.  But
	 		 	 now she hosts mics and showcases and co-produces shows as Broken Zipper.  Allie
	  	 	 loves the community Broken Zipper creates because the audience is supportive
		 	 	 and the comics are diverse and love their craft. Allie has a style of comedy
		  	 which is a mix of stories, performance art and weird observations.</div>

			 <div class="title" style="color:#49fb35;">Dorothy Geary</div>
			 <br>
			 <div class="year">When Dorothy started standup, she had no idea she would become so caught
				  up in the Portland comedy community.  The comedians and audience, who
					are almost all much younger, welcomed her to standup as a performer and
					 host. Now Dorothy also loves co-producing Broken Zipper Comedy shows
					 that represent the full range of diverse comedians and comedic styles
					 from Portland and out of state comedians.  She also actively supports
					 the growth of new comedians.</div>
